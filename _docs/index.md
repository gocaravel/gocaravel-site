### The Food Delivery Industry

One of the fastest growing markets today is food delivery. In 2018, the food
delivery industry produced $82 billion in revenue. With a cumulative growth
rate of 14%, this industry is set to explode in the coming years [1].

Almost all food delivery services operate under a similar premise. Customers
choose what they want to order on an app, and the service pays a driver to pick
up and deliver the food. Customers are charged for the price of their meal,
plus a service fee (usually a certain percentage of the overall value of their
meal). A delivery fee is often charged as well (but may be waived in some
cases), and many platforms will charge a small order fee for orders under a
certain price [2].

With all these fees, food delivery can be quite expensive for consumers.
Studies have found that consumers often have multiple food delivery apps
installed on their phone at a given time, and are not particularly loyal, often
using whatever service has a particular restaurant they're interested in [3].

Services primarily compete with each other based on restaurant selection, as
platforms are unable to compete on price. Many platforms have a 'membership'
option, where for a monthly fee, customers get free delivery on that platform.
Customers are still charged service fees, however [4]. Services are
unable to compete on price primarily due to their largest cost, food
couriers, being common across all platforms. If couriers and drivers were
required, by law, to be paid more for their services, the price of food
delivery would increase [5].

### An Autonomous Solution for Food Delivery

It is apparent a need exists for a method to deliver food from restaurants to
customers without needing a courier. A method that circumvents a courier would
allow a platform to undercut their competitors on what customers care most
about: cost, and to make food delivery cheaper and more accessible.
