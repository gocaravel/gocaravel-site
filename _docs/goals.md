### Scope

The vision driving this project is to develop a perception system for an
unmanned, autonomous delivery vehicle. The vehicle would be specifically
designed to carry groceries and takeout instead of human passengers, and be
equipped with the hardware necessary to enable autonomous capabilities.

Outside of our capstone, we are part of a larger team working on designing a
hardware prototype as well as implementing software modules that would enable
the vehicle to self-drive. The software modules are tested on a 2019
Toyota Corolla Hatchback.

However, due to the immense scope of building complete hardware and software
prototypes, the focus of this capstone is selected to only encompass portions
of the perception system of the software prototype.


An autonomous delivery vehicle would eliminate the largest cost in deliveries:
the driver. Due to the immense scope of the perception system for an autonomous
vehicle, this project will cover the design and implementation of Automatic
Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Centering/Lane Following.

ACC is a system that allows a vehicle to autonomously maintain a set distance between it and a vehicle in front of it regardless of the behaviour of the leading vehicle.  Lane Following is a system that allows a vehicle to automatically steer itself to keep itself in a designated lane.
