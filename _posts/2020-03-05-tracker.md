In our previous post, we described how temporal consistency was a major concern
in postprocessing network outputs. Even across two similar frames, the network
was not guaranteed to have similar outputs; as a result, the path sent
downstream to the planner would not be very consistent.

At this stage, we have only implemented outlier rejection. Here's a reminder
of what the network output looked like:

<p align = 'center'>
<img src = '/assets/img/post_filter.gif' width = '256'>
</p>

<p align = 'center'><i>

Clearly, the postprocessing routine needs a way to ensure that the fitted
polyline remains consistent between two frames, even when the network produces
sparse detections in a particular frame.

We experimented with various methods to accomplish this, such as smoothing the
polyline coefficients. However, eventually we settled on a method that worked
quite well.

Here is our path stabilization in action. It is clear that the final polyline
is far more consistent than before, even when the network produces unreliable
output. Furthermore, the path no longer fits to the more prominent detections
on the center lane line towards the end - it sticks with the right lane line
all the way through.

<p align = 'center'>
<img src = '/assets/img/post_tracking.gif' width = '256'>
</p>

frames to stabilize the final polyline. The blue regions show pixels that
are above the threshold but

We realized that polylines were not very good at extrapolating past observed
data points. If in one frame the entire lane line was detected but in the next
frame only a segment of the lane line was detected, then the fitted polylines for
consecutive frames could be wildly different.

To counteract this, "waypoints" along the image are used to create the final
polyline rather than using the raw network outputs. Each of the waypoints has a
Kalman Filter attached to it and the network is treated as a distance sensor of
sorts.  When a network produces detections, the waypoint positions are updated.

Futhermore, the waypoint positions from the previous frame are fed back into the
outlier rejection algorithm to add an additional layer of temporal consistency.
