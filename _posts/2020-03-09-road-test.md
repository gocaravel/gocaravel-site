Today we manage to do a road test running the entire stack end to end. On the
bright side the perception stack is tracking the path of the car very well and
the planner plan looks very reasonable. Unfortunately, it seems that the
planner is over-actuating. Going slowly, we are able to follow a road but the
car would swing side to side. If there was a curve in the road, the planner
sometimes drove the car off the road.

We hope to investigate these issues further and fine tune the planner parameters
to obtain smoother commands.
