Welcome to the Caravel Project. This blog serves to provide updates throughout
the timeline of our project. Hopefully it will provide you a good overview of
the steps we took into developing our integrated Perception system. We will
hopefully cover all the stages of our project, such as collected data,
actuating the vehicle, processing the data, developing our network and
integrating our planner! Look out for future posts.
