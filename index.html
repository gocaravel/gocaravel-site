        <h1>On the way to Autonomous Delivery</h1>
        <p>

        Our vision is an end to end autonomous vehicle designed specifically to
        handle item deliveries in urban environments.  Current food delivery
        solutions depend on human couriers to achieve product fulfillment. If
        self driving vehicles were employed instead, delivery fees could be
        dramatically reduced. Our project focuses on the perception systems
        that would power such a vehicle.

        The core motivation for this project is the concept of a compact,
        low-cost self driving vehicle designed specifically to carry groceries
        and takeout orders instead of passengers.

        Because the vision for this project is quite demanding, the scope of our
        capstone has been reduced to only include select software components of
        an autonomous delivery vehicle. Specifically, the perception system is
        chosen as the primary subject of our capstone.

        We implement vision algorithms to accomplish lane following, as well
        as various other modules such as actuation and planning, and test them
        on a 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback.
