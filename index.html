        <h1>On the way to Autonomous Delivery</h1>
        <p>

        Our vision is an end to end autonomous vehicle designed specifically to
        handle item deliveries in urban environments.  Current food delivery
        solutions depend on human couriers to achieve product fulfillment. If
        self driving vehicles were employed instead, delivery fees could be
        dramatically reduced. Our project focuses on the perception systems
        that would power such a vehicle.

        One of the fastest growing markets in 2020 is food delivery. Especially
        in cities where traffic congestion is common and it is not feasible to
        own a car, people are finding it increasingly advantageous to use services
        such as InstaCart or Uber Eats to retrieve groceries or meals.

        Unfortunately, delivery fees are quite expensive. When getting takeout
        delivered, the cost of deliveries may be on par with the price of the
        original meal in extreme cases. If delivery fees could be reduced, then
        food delivery would be viable to a much wider range of people.

        One way to reduce delivery fees would be to employ autonomous vehicles
        instead of human drivers. The core motivation for this project is the
        concept of a compact, low-cost self driving vehicle designed
        specifically to carry groceries and takeout orders instead of
        passengers that could navigate the streets of an urban environment.

        As the vision for this project is quite demanding, the scope of our
        capstone has been reduced to only include select software components of
        an autonomous delivery vehicle. Specifically, the perception system is
        chosen as the primary subject of our capstone.
